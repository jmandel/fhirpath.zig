Read all mds in repo root and follow the methodology by running choose_mode, then proceed with this step autonomously making progress as long as you can.

Before the final status line, output exactly one line:
ONE-LINE LOG: <high-signal summary of what changed or learned, <=140 chars>

Then output exactly one of:
STEP COMPLETE
STEP FAILED
PROJECT FINISHED

Context:
- One-line logs accumulate across sessions for future prompts.
- Full logs are in ./logs and are very verbose; use rg/grep if you need to inspect history.
- Blockers are managed via wiggum/scripts/blockers.py (do not hand-edit the blockers file).
- If choose_mode selects TACKLE_BLOCKER, it will print a Blocker slug; use the blockers script to show/update/resolve it.
- Git commits must include a detailed body (not just a one-line subject). Use subject + blank line + bullet list of changes/tests.
- In any mode, if you discover an urgent external blocker, add it via the blockers script with an excellent bug-report style description (clear steps, rationale, pointers).
