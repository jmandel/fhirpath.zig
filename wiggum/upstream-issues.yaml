# Upstream Issues (YAML)
#
# Track issues to report to FHIRPath specification/reference implementation maintainers.
# Format is simple YAML for deterministic parsing by scripts.
# Only single-line values are supported.
#
# Allowed status values: draft, ready, reported, acknowledged, fixed, wontfix, duplicate
# Allowed severity values: low, medium, high, critical
# Allowed category values: spec-ambiguity, spec-error, test-error, test-missing, clarification
# Allowed target values: fhirpath-editors, fhir-test-cases, fhir-jira
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Add issue with status=draft while investigating
#   2. Change to status=ready when ready to file upstream
#   3. Run `upstream.py report <slug>` to generate report, then update to status=reported
#   4. Update to acknowledged/fixed/wontfix/duplicate based on upstream response
